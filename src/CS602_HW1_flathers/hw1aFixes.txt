The reason why the objects being returned by the module are being edited is due to array mutability within JS.

a = ['foo', 'bar']
b = a
a[0] = 'other'

console.log(a) //[other,bar]
console.log(b) //[other,bar]

To avoid this, you need to generate a new array with the same values as the original array.

a.map(val => {b.push(val)});

This will avoid the mutability that comes with JS. Any method within the module that uses, in my case, employeeArray with be affected by mutability.
